# Implementation and solver for tic-tac-two

### Game description:
- Two players take turns placing their pieces on a 3-by-3 grid (similar to regular tic-tac-toe)
- Player wins if they have 3 claimed squares in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
- Player claims square when they are the first to get 2 of their own piece on the square

### Updates:
10/2/20 (brian): Uploaded own base code, with possible TT2 implementation. No guarantee it actually works, and definetly not efficient.

9/30/20 (janise): uploaded tic tac toe, solver, and Game abstract class to use as base code
